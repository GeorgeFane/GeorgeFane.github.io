# GeorgeFane.github.io

GeorgeFane.github.io is my personal site, built with React.js. It has RatingsMap, which shows all ratings for a TV show in a heatmap; CryptoCharity, a blockchain MVP using Solidity and web3.js to increase charity accountability; CryptoQuotes, which quotes more than 5000 coins; and MDiningScraper, which aggregates all dining hall menus into one easy-to-use table.

## Things to Add

* map to MDining with open and closed halls
* line chart to CryptoQuotes
* Payoff Matrix Solver backend
