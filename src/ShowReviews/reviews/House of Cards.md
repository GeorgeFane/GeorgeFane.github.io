# House of Cards
#### 17 Feb 2021

Liked this show a lot the first time through. The very first scene is shockingly violent and was right up my alley at the time (I was also watching Hannibal). I loved the first three seasons (I really enjoyed Frank's conniving and angling to the Presidency), didn't like the next two as much, and didn't watch the sixth.

The most recent time I tried watching it (either my second or third watch), it was a little too boring to get through. Additionally, by that time Kevin Spacey's #MeToo revelations came out, and people watching this show were faced with the question of whether you can separate the artist from the art. I absolutely can. The show is the same before and after, which means the acting and writing and directing is just as good. If the work is fiction, the actor and their character are different, so I can happily root for the character without supporting the actor. Let's take an example on the other side. I love the movie Forrest Gump, but Tom Hank's wholesomeness in real life doesn't make his performance any better.

On a different note, take a look at the heatmap below. The first five seasons have amazing ratings judging by their coloring, but the awfulness of the 6th seasons probably makes everything else seem great. I don't just mean that qualitatively; I believe that lower minimums make the higher ratings have less of a difference in color, by the mechanics of Pandas's background_gradient function that I use. Looking at the numbers, the first five seasons have ratings in line with Better Call Saul, but the latter has a higher variety of shades.
