# Twin Peaks
#### 12 March 2021

I'm done with the first two seasons and not the third, but I really enjoy this show. Here's what I wrote in my journal yesterday:

Finished Season 2 of Twin Peaks today. Honestly don’t think it was that bad. It had the problem of retelling things, but it didn’t take away too much of the experience. Maybe some of the supernatural stuff was missing and Windom Earle was a typical insane antagonist, but I quite enjoyed it. The finale was beautiful and ‘made it all worth it’, even though the season stood up on its own. 

Outside of the surreal elements, which I'll discuss below, I enjoy the show. I tried watching Mulholland Drive but was bored after the first half-hour and stopped because of the sprawling storylines, but the expansiveness and randomness really works in a funny show like this one. This probably drives my favorable opinion of the second season. I didn't notice a significant drop-off after the first season, unlike The Office after Michael leaves or Mad Men after Season 6 (Season 7 is still great, but the rapid pace is a definite departure from style and its peak).

The surrealism and David Lynch's style, though, are the clearest draws. There is a clip on YouTube of Cooper's dream in the third episode, with the girl who looks like Laura Palmer and the little man. The randomness of the man's dialogue and the backwards talking (anything inverted is interesting after Tenet) were intriguing. This comment is significant to me:

It's unfortunate, but other people's opinions definitely affect my own. Arlo hyping up the show definitely kept me open to continuing even after I couldn't finish the pilot (no surrealism and I wasn't used to the randomness at the time). I expect other people to be right, which is why I trust Rotten Tomatoes a lot in guiding what content I consume and why I was so disappointed in Ingrid Goes West: RT made me expect something better.

In contrast to WandaVision, the visuals in this show that are meant to stun really do. The third season's scene with the eyeless woman was incredible both on YouTube, where I first watched it, and during my actual watch of the third season. While I haven't gotten to the nuclear bomb scene later in the season, commenters on YouTube have rave reviews, and I agree. It's incredibly unique.

This is a definite recommend. My friends watch Riverdale and All-American, and complain about their declines in quality; I don't know much about those shows but I'd put them on Twin Peaks.
