# Roman Holiday (1953)
#### Written 17 May 2021, watched 17 May

Great. Breakfast at Tiffany's was pretty good, and this was even better. This movie was mentioned in Rick Riordan's Mark of Athena, when Percy and Annabeth are in Rome. I think they meet the personification of the River Tiber and his girlfriend or wife, and they're dressed like Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. The two descriptions I remember are 'a baby-blue moped' and 'high-waisted pants that somehow didn't make him look like a complete goofball' (paraphrased, definitely).

Wonderful chemistry between Peck and Audrey. Good physical comedy when Joe screws around with Irving, and the first scene with the shoe is quite funny.
