# Homeland
#### 25 April 2021

This show is incredible. I started it on March 25th and finished it on April 19th. That's 25 days for 96 episodes (hours) of content, which averages to 4 episodes per day. My goodness, that's a lot. Especially during the school year. Last week was when classes ended, to give students time to study for finals in the week ahead of us. That Monday, I watched the last ten episodes of the series, just to procrastinate on studying.

The first season was amazing, wrapped around the mystery of who Brody really was. When I saw him praying, I thought, 'he's a goner'. When Carrie confronts him at the lake and he says to 'put a gun to my head', I thought he completely explained himself, even though looking back I shouldn't have believed him. On a different note, many reviews said that if Brody did go through with his plan in the finale and the show ended there, Homeland would have cemented itself as the greatest miniseries of all time. I would've enjoyed that, but I also enjoyed what we got: you might be possessed by an idea, drilled into you for years and years, but just a few minutes of contact with your loved ones could clear your mind. Unrelated, but the two-minute no-cut scene at the end of Episode 10, when David tears down Carrie's wall, was incredible and really stuck with me. I now see why SNL made that Homeland sketch.

I quite liked the second season, but I noticed that it had less draw than the first. By that I mean there wasn't as intense an urge to watch the next episode after finishing one. I think it lost the central mystery that kept me going. Brody's character is completely known by this point; the only question is Quinn, but he doesn't have the same attachment to Carrie or the same possibility to be a villain. He's just there to do one thing for Dar Adal. It was still good, though. I read a few show reviews about the series finale, mentioning 'creative missteps' in the second season, but the reviews didn't elaborate on that, so I still don't understand what they mean. The finale was great. I wish Claire and Brody had become fugitives together, like Hannibal and Will could in the fourth season, or Eve and Villanelle could've after the second season.

I especially wished that when we saw Brody's condition in the third season. His story was just a ton of sitting and waiting, and I thought that would be his fate before Saul picked him up. Similarly, it was painful to watch Carrie go through the public humiliation that she planned with Saul, but I really loved the last few episodes, both the Special Ops side and the emotional side, when Carrie has to say goodbye to Brody.

The show was dealt a big blow by losing Brody, but the fourth season was pretty good. It was mildly amusing to see Duck Phillips again, who resembled his later-season stint in Mad Men as a rather powerless man overshadowed by a stronger woman (Peggy there, Martha here). The hallucination sequence with the Pakistani colonel was nice in that we saw Brody again, but Carrie opening herself up didn't have the same effect as when she did with Yevgeny Gromov. In this season, Carrie and the colonel just exchange intelligence a couple times. The Benghazi sequence in the later episodes was amazing; but the Senator/Director should've steeled himself and not opened the door. If Quinn and the soldier had just fired sooner, I bet Haqqani and his buddies would've run away all the same as if the door had opened. The last episode was awful. I had expected closure on Haqqani, but we just had to live with him running away into the mountains. We didn't have the action of the last three finales. IMDb backs me up: look at that singular white cell below at s4e12. Quinn coming onto Carrie was dumb, because that one-way romance was basically a one-off line from Dar Adal and not backed up by their interactions in past seasons. Carrie's rejection was a nice driver for him to go to Syria, though.

The fifth season was good, but Allison and Saul getting together was extremely sudden. It was strictly professional, even adversarial, and suddenly they're seen sharing a bed. The ending Saul designed for her was extremely cold, but I suppose it made sense for him. The Otto During proposition at the end was pretty dumb; he wanted someone that had big ideas, which translates better to a business partnership rather than a romantic one. I felt bad for Quinn; I thought he would be completely immune to the sarin because of his injection, and that his spasms in the beginning were fake. Pretty soon we realize that they weren't, but at least he lived. Later, Carrie made the right decision in trying to wake him up, but his state in the next season was regrettable. Also, I really liked the long-cut scene where Saul downloads the files for Carrie. I rewatched it a few times to admire the camera movement and smoothness.

I really did not like the sixth season. It seemed to turn into a legal drama, and Sekou was quite unwise continuing to post videos when his deal hinged on the shutting down of his content creation. It was painful to watch Quinn, and his decision-making the hostage-taking episode was awful. Shooting the protester was alright because he threw rocks, but I thought he would stop with all of that business when they dispersed and the cops showed up. I was relieved when we learned that Carrie was secretly advising Keane, because otherwise the show wouldn't've extended past piddly shit. Dar Adal admitting that he 'forced himself on' Quinn was a stupid, underdeveloped thing to include, as was his relationship with a male GWU professor in the finale. Singular, throwaway lines with no backup. The rest of the finale was awful; how could the Secret Service take a bomb threat seriously when the hotel is swept all the time? Someone even tells Carrie that before the cars exit the garage. I can believe a team of Deltas is radicalized to kill the President, but not all the military guys standing at the edge of the kill zone. That was way more than the handful of people in that SpecOps safe house. At least Quinn got a nice, purposeful ending, and the next season was set up well on the foundation of a tyrannical president.

I don't have much to say about the last two seasons, but I liked them a lot, much more than Season 6. While most seasons have a slow start, I could tell immediately that the last season was good. The last ten minutes of the series could've been stretched into a half-hour epilogue, but it was a sweet, sort of fairytale ending. I liked it.
