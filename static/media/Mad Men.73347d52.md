# Mad Men
#### 17 Feb 2021

Probably my favorite show. I've watched it twice all the way through, and I'm on Season 5 in a slow 3rd watch.

It's a very slow show, even more so than Better Call Saul, and for me it's often hard to describe what's so great at it. One review I read characterized the show as several episodes of emotions festering under the surface culminating in rare confrontations, and those confrontations are the best episodes of the show.

Namely, s4e7'The Suitcase'. Peggy airs her grievances about Glo-Coat and Don is forced to come to terms with Anna (Don's few visits to Anna were some of the sweetest moments of the show). Characters honestly talking about their feelings and fast plots are anathema. The show so conditions you to think this way that Don's admission to Peggy in s7e6 'Waterloo' that he has no one feels almost out of character. Furthermore, it sometimes still shocks me to remember that Don's cross-country trip is entirely contained by the show's LAST TWO episodes.

On my second and third watches through, I developed a more negative view of the first season. It's still good, but Don comes across as a cliché curt boss. The exposition from Midge about Don in the pilot is painful to listen through. However, Adam coming in and Don's flashbacks mark a turning point in the season from somewhat boring and cliché to the interesting, complex show that Mad Men is known for.

Fun fact: this is the show that I tended to use as test data when developing my RatingsMap application
