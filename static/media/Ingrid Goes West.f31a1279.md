# Ingrid Goes West
#### 17 Feb 2021

I had high hopes for this film that went unanswered. I love Aubrey Plaza in Parks and Rec and the Little Hours, and Olsen in WandaVision, and I thought that Plaza would play a much more violent, deranged character. The first scene, focusing on Ingrid's wide-open, crying yet emotionless eyes set the expectation that she would eventually kill Olsen's character, particularly because Ingrid goes from crying in her car to spraying mace at a bride.

Thinking about it now, Ingrid is impressive for hiding her manic obsession for Olsen's character when in her presence (think about their first dinner together and the trip to Joshua Tree). Also, her rash purchase of the house next to Taylor's and complete focus on watching Taylor rather than paying the bills is unique, but I was (unhappily) surprised that she left Taylor's brother alive. I think it would've shown the depth of her obsession and also, Taylor's brother deserved it.

The ending was guessable and too easy for what Ingrid deserved. Dan Pinto is happy to see her after saving her life: the latter is basically a human obligation, but the former is extra. I guess her post going viral has a good lesson about being yourself, but it's still too nice for her after her behavior during the movie.

The several minutes between Ingrid macing the bride and discovering Taylor are boring. It's likely intentional, to show that Ingrid doesn't have much going on in her life, but as Matthew Weiner said about Mad Men s7e1, "It only takes a couple shots to convince the audience that a character is not up to much." The start of her time in LA is also a drag; the film should've taken much less time on Ingrid copying Taylor's interests and more time on their direct interactions.

You can tell I didn't like the story (certain parts of writing were weak as well, like Dan Pinto's clunky exposition during his dinner with Ingrid: "As an orphan, I related to that". Who talks like that casually?). The acting was nice, though. The leads were good, and Taylor's brother was expertly portrayed to make me hate him.

Still, I do not recommend this. Most films and shows I review on this site are my favorites, but not this one.
