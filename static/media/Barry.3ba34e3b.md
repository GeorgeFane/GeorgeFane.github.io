Great show. I've watched it 3 times through, with the most recent time being last week. The acting is phenomenal. It still astounds me how comedic actors like Bill Hader can deliver incredible dramatic performances. Some of the other characters are grating (I was annoyed by the actor types during the pilot), but that's probably an intentional move by the show, to satirize the LA acting scene.

## Highlights:

'My lord, the Queen is dead' - s1e7

Barry's face dropping emotion after Janice - s1e8, s2e6

'WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?' - s1e7

'FUUUUCHES!' - s2e8
