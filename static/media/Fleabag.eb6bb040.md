# Fleabag
#### 17 Feb 2021

Amazing. Very unique (I haven't seen so much fourth-wall breaking since House of Cards) and it excellently interweaves comedy with really depressing moments.

The 2 seasons you see below are the entire show. With 6 episodes per season and 30 minutes per episode, the entire show is only 6 hours long. You really wish there's more coming, but the creator says she's done with it. Unfortunate.

The final episodes of both seasons are phenomenal. The first is very revelatory and finally shows what the protagonist has been dealing with the whole season. The episode is great because the protagonist comes to terms with that issue.

The second finale is lovely for the bus stop scene between Fleabag and the Priest ('It'll pass'). Watching Fleabag walk away from the camera, it makes sense why the show stops there, but you still want more.
