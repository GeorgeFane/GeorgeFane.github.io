# The Kominsky Method
#### 23 March 2021

I finished this show today, a Tuesday, and I started it right before a Michigan Investment Group meeting on Sunday. It's really short, only 30 minutes an episode, and contains 16 total episodes over two seasons. It's got Fleabag length.

This is an extremely funny show, going through the problems that old people face. Of the two leads (or maybe not: I saw Michael Douglas nominated for Lead Actor and Alan Arkin for Supporting Actor in this year's Emmies), Arkin's Norman Newlander makes me laugh more. He's an abrasive, honest, and philosophical person that at times reminds of Larry David's character in Curb Your Enthusiasm (speaking of which: despite being centered on Douglas's Sandy Kominsky, the beginning funeral portion of s1e3 really evoked a Curb episode). Norman's interrupted eulogy at the end of s1e2, less than two minutes long, brought tears to my eyes, both when I watched the whole episode and when I searched for the clip on YouTube. The plainly-worded but specific memories of his wife, combined with Arkin's excellent performance, were perfectly crushing.

I'm trying to think of what I liked about Season 2, and it has to be Norman getting over his grief and dating Madelyn, played by Jane Seymour. My favorite parts center on Norman, which is limiting considering that Arkin will not return for Season 3. Kominsky's first ex-wife will take his place. It might work out, but I'm sad that Norman won't be there.

There are parallels with other shows I've watched. I mentioned Fleabag for their similar runtimes, but they also both have a main character dealing with their grief over losing someone special to them. A difference, and I particularly noticed this with the Season 2 finale, is that there isn't a great, impactful resolution at the end of the season that typical finales contain. The last line of Season 2 is about Kominsky's slow urination, a problem that was introduced in s1e3, treated somewhat with Martin's help, and not brought up much later in Season 2. It has the same lightness as the other episodes in the season, which contrasts sharply with Fleabag's two very heavy and cathartic season finales.

There's also Barry, for the shallow reason that both shows have an acting coach. In this, too, Barry might be better for showing Gene Cousineau's emotional lows at the end of Season 2.

Despite my comparisons, this show is great and a recommended watch. Gutbustingly funny, particularly due to Arkin's performance.
