# Tenet
#### 18 Feb 2021

Probably my favorite film right now. The concept is just so cool and invites rewatching even more than other Nolan films (I think I've watched this 5 times).

## Why I Watched

Choosing to watch this film was an easy decision. I love Nolan movies and JDW was great in BlacKKKlansman. And I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack: what a banger. I had been a fan of Ludwig Gorannson since his work for Black Panther, and I listened to the Tenet soundtrack religiously. 

I always played it during basketball on the Oxford Houses basketball court (it pumped me up), and the habit got to the point where if I had my earbuds in around other people, they knew I was listening to Tenet. It was a bit goofy at times; I explained to someone that one track, 'Trucks in Place', has a reversed sample of a firetruck siren, so I found that track reversed to listen to a forward firetruck siren. They looked at me like the concerned parent of a kid who just chugged glue.

## Nolan Movie Flaws

These are definitely there: poor audio mixing, clunky exposition, confusing plot. They didn't detract from my experience, though. On the flaw of exposition, perhaps the audience noted the trailer's lack of specificity and is hungry for details and mechanics while watching the movie. Maybe the spy genre lends itself to continual discovery of information.

The crappy audio made a difficult plot even more complex. Sator's motivation wasn't great, and was even worse what for the song 'Posterity' blasting. Same thing during the Kyiv Opera Siege: 'Rainy Night in Tallinn' is great, but not when the Protagonist is talking.

## Upsides

We have an issue today of reboots, adaptations, and nonfiction works; I want original screenplays like Inception, Shape of Water, and Skeleton Twins. Tenet blows these out of the water with not just an original screenplay but an original idea of traveling back in time not by a time jump but second by second. The reverse fight scenes and car chase are incredible, and I particularly enjoyed the RED ROOM BLUE ROOM interrogation, where inverted Sator questions the normal Protagonist.

## Verdict

Definitely recommend. With captions.
