# Death of Stalin
#### 17 Feb 2021

This is the reason why I felt the need for a movie watchlist. This is the movie I thought about and forgot as described on the homepage.

I watched this for the first time on a plane, I think, because of the creator Armando Iannucci (he also created Veep, on of my favorite shows). The film is a standout for portraying a complex and serious power struggle in such a funny way.
