# WandaVision

I really loved the first three episodes*, and my opinion dropped as the show had less sitcom and more present-day Marvel show.

*I'm looking at the RatingsMap now and I'm flabbergasted as to why the episodes I like have the worst ratings out of the whole season

The first episode was phenomenal for me. I'd never really watched the early shows that created the sitcom genre, so taking in the premier's '50s-style comedy was very entertaining and fresh*.  It had lots of laughs, and the sudden tone shift during the dinner party downright disturbed me, as was its purpose. Can't describe enough how good this episode was.

*Because of this show, I watched a few clips of I Love Lucy and Golden Girls.

The greater focus starting Episode 4 on the 'present-day', or the world outside Westview, made the rest of the season more tedious to watch. I feel that the show devolves into the typical Marvel writing that is not known for emblemizing prestige TV. Think of Marvel's Agents of Shield (I don't know much about it except that nobody talks about it) and the snarky quips that aren't that funny.

The 8th episode was particularly a pain. The show needed exposition to set up the finale, but I suppose I don't like it when it's obviously exposition and all crammed together. I prefer spaced-out info drops along the series that slowly build. As an example, the small, perplexing indicators in the season's first third, that things might not be as pleasant as they seem, really built my interest in the show.

Of course the finale had a massive fight, like the 'third act brouhaha' that always show up in Marvel films, as I believe the YouTube channel HonestTrailers calls it. I know audiences like it, but it's not for me. Other shows have cooler visuals on lower budgets.

I recommend that you watch this show. There's a high chance you'll like it, but I know I won't rewatch it.
