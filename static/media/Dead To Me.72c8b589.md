# Dead to Me
#### 17 Feb 2021

Really liked this show when I watched it. I decided to watch it because it had good ratings and because Linda Cardinelli was also in Mad Men.

I tried to rewatch it, but for some reason couldn't get past the pilot. I think the great payoff of Season 1 is Christina Applegate's character learning the truth about Linda Cardinelli's character, maybe the revelation wouldn't be as impactful the second time through.
