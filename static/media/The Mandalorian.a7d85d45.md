# The Mandalorian
#### 23 March 2021

This is just a straightforward, enjoyable show. That's not to disparage it; the show is all about the dedication that Mando has for the Child, which is different from most shows I like that have a messed up main character. It reminds me of the Honest Trailers channel's description of Hell or High Water: so straightforward and enjoyable it has no chance of winning Best Picture. 

The two season seemed similar in quality. I recall social media posts describing the second season as a continual stream of side quests, but I didn't notice while watching. The hallway scene was great, even though I don't particularly like any of the nine Star Wars movies, and the subsequent goodbye was touching. Mando, Bo-Katan, and the other two taking the gunship (s2e4)  was a great sequence, as was Mando hunting down his heist accomplices in the Imperial prison (s1e6)*.

*Random, but this was the thing I watched right before learning how to juggle. I told that story for a BCOM 250 assignment.

It's strange that my attitude has become so lukewarm toward this show. This is a definite recommend, even for those, like me, who aren't Star Wars fans. Similar to Wandavision, there is a very high chance that you'll enjoy this show. The cute little Grogu probably had the merchandise sales of an entire movie, and seeing social media's adoration for the little rascal was a definite draw for me to start this show.

For how good the show is, the soundtrack is even better. In the very first scene of the series, Mando's theme, that will soon be familiar to you, gives way to an industrial, bass-heavy section that complements the visual side of the sequence: Mando easily kills the other bounty hunters who are competing with him to take a target. It tells you that this quiet, armored figure is an intimidating expert.

I'm realizing now that my favorite tracks from the two seasons of soundtracks play during my favorite scenes. 'Little Mousey' plays while Mando takes out his crewmates in the s1e6 prison, and 'Ship o hoj, Mandalorians' takes place during the s2e4 raid on the gunship (I really like the part around 7:00). 'Troopers' and 'A Friend', subsequent songs in the Season 2 finale, contain unexpected but retrospectively perfect dubstep. I'm not a fan of dubstep, but for a while I listened to these two songs during my morning walks, to wake me up for the day's classes.

It's simply a magnficient soundtrack. It's made by Ludwig Goranssen, the same guy who scored Tenet and Black Panther.
