# Better Call Saul

#### 17 Feb 2021

Really love this show. I watched Better Call Saul the whole way through before Breaking Bad (I watched the pilot of BB during middle school and was put off by the violence), and I like it better than Breaking Bad, which is atypical for people who've watched both.

It has a very slow start, particularly for people who have watched BB prior. I hadn't, so the slow pace was a surprise but not a deal breaker. Perhaps those fans expected more of the cartel side rather than Jimmy's law side, but I enjoyed watching Jimmy's slow decline into Saul.

The seasons get better as you go on (you can see that the season means across the bottom mostly keep increasing), and the fifth season, particularly the last few episodes, are amazing. You simply can't look away from the 'Tell Me Again' scene in S5E9, and Jimmy screaming at Howard is very memorable. Also, Howard's continual 'Have you thought about the job?' is hilarious.

Other highlights include Chuck's rant in S3E5 'Chicanery'.
